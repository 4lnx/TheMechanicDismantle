[h2]Notes:[/h2]
"Chance of obtaining items when disassembling," this setting still depends on the character's 
Metallurgy and Mechanics level.
The higher the skill levels, the more items drop, and the faster the disassembly.
Player has an additional 5% bonus for each Trait, BLACKSMITH, and CRAFTY.

[h3]Practical example: [/h3]
Player with:
. BaseChance = 10%
. TotalSkillLevels = 12
. Useful Traits = 2

[code] DropChance = 10 + (2 x 12) + (5 x 2) = 44%

The item will drop if:
Random(0.99) < DropChance[/code]

The 10% value is quite conservative; a player with few skills generates little loot, 
but when they have higher levels, they generate a lot of loot.
