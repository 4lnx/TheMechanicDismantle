description=[h2]Notes:[/h2]
description="Chance of obtaining items when disassembling," this setting still depends on the character's 
description=Metallurgy and Mechanics level.
description=The higher the skill levels, the more items drop, and the faster the disassembly.
description=Player has an additional 5% bonus for each Trait, BLACKSMITH, and CRAFTY.
description=
description=[h3]Practical example: [/h3]
description=Player with:
description=. BaseChance = 10%
description=. TotalSkillLevels = 12
description=. Useful Traits = 2
description=
description=[code] DropChance = 10 + (2 x 12) + (5 x 2) = 44%
description=
description=The item will drop if:
description=Random(0.99) < DropChance[/code]
description=
description=The 10% value is quite conservative; a player with few skills generates little loot, 
description=but when they have higher levels, they generate a lot of loot.
